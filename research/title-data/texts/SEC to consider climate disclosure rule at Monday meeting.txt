Securities regulators in the United States were expected to take a long-awaited step on Monday and require publicly traded companies to report more information to investors about their impact on climate change and any plans they have to reduce the release of greenhouse gases.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, at a meeting Monday morning, will consider the much-anticipated climate disclosure rule, which has been a centerpiece in the regulatory agenda of Gary Gensler, the commission’s chairman. The commission could vote on the measure at the meeting.

The proposed rule, which will be open to public comments for at least 60 days, would set up a reporting framework that would require all companies to begin providing information about the climate-related impact of their businesses in their annual reports.

The rule is expected to generate controversy with some in the business community and may be challenged in court — something that could delay its effective date. The S.E.C. has sought to get ahead of the anticipated opposition by pointing out that the commission has been issuing guidance to companies about disclosing information on the environmental impact of their businesses for several decades.
