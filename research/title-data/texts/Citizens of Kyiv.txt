Ukrainians and the War

About two million people who remain in Kyiv are galvanized by a newfound unity and defiance against Russia’s invasion.

To capture this moment in the war, a Times reporter spoke with four Ukrainian women who escaped. Here are their stories in their own words.

Russians and the War

President Vladimir V. Putin has used a barrage of increasingly outlandish falsehoods to prop up his overarching claim that the invasion is justified.

Russian forces captured an apartment complex outside Kyiv and held residents hostage. Some of it was caught on camera.

On the Diplomatic Front

The U.S. has tried to strike a tenuous balance between aiding Ukraine and avoiding an escalation with Russia.

Pope Francis has avoided describing Mr. Putin as the aggressor. Some analysts say that the choice could complicate his legacy.
