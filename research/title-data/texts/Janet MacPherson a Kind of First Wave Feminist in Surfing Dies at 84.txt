In the 1950s, when she was in her teens and early 20s, Janet MacPherson was something of a rare sight in the waters off Hawaii and California: a woman on a surfboard at a time when men dominated that activity.

But to Ben Marcus, the author (with the photographer Lucia Griggi) of the 2017 book “Women Who Surf: Charging Waves With the World’s Best,” that wasn’t even the most remarkable thing about Ms. MacPherson. To him, it was that she could still be found riding a board more than a half-century later.

Yes, it was unusual to see a woman on the waves in the 1950s, he said by email, but “more unusual for a woman to be surfing, and surfing well, into her 70s and 80s — and she was surfing well.”

Ms. MacPherson, a fixture on the shores of Southern California and seemingly anywhere else that good surfing might be found, died on March 5 at her home on Carbon Beach in Malibu. She was 84. Her son, Sean MacPherson, the well-known hotelier and restaurateur, said the cause was cancer.

Mr. MacPherson would often surf alongside his mother, which may have been inevitable: She rode the waves while pregnant with him in New Zealand in the mid-1960s. “I was surfing before I was born,” he once told The New York Times.

By then, Ms. MacPherson had been surfing for a decade.

“I was one of the first female surfers in California,” she told The Surfer’s Journal in 2014.

That distinction had its perils. Mr. MacPherson said that in his mother’s early years, male surfers would sometimes throw rocks at her because they didn’t want a woman on their waves. When she bought her first board at a shop in Venice, Calif., she told The Surfer’s Journal, “I could tell what they were thinking: ‘Oh, yeah, a woman.’”

“But they sold me the board,” she added, “and off I went.”

Ms. MacPherson’s circle included Philip (Flippy) Hoffman, a famed big-wave rider, and the surfboard maker Renny Yater, and she overcame the early resistance to become a pioneering figure as surfing grew in the 1960s and beyond. In the waters near her Malibu home, she was revered.

“Surfing and vying for waves at Malibu can be quite competitive,” her son said by email. “Whenever Janet caught a wave, everyone — truly everyone — backed off and gave her the right of way. Janet was in a category of one.”

Janet Lucille MacPherson was born on March 24, 1937, in San Francisco. Her father, Kenneth, was part of the family that owned MacPherson Leather Company, a saddle maker. Her mother, Maria Dolores Cabanillas MacPherson, was born to a prominent family in Mazatlán, Mexico.

As a graduation present when she finished her studies at Convent of the Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco, Ms. MacPherson’s parents gave her a trip to Hawaii, where she caught the surfing bug.

“I was with my sister in Hawaii in 1955 and watched my then boyfriend surfing,” she told Whalebone magazine five years ago. “I thought it would be fun to try.”

In 1957, she moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., to study at Santa Barbara City College — she later graduated from San Francisco State University — and began spending a lot of time on the waves at Rincon Point, which wasn’t yet the popular surfing spot it would become.

“You had to beg people to surf with you back then,” she said.

One aspect of surfing that had at first discouraged women from participating, Mr. Marcus said, was that early surfboards were big and heavy and hard to wrangle.

“Only the burliest men could handle the big hardwood surfboards of the first half of the 20th century,” he said. But by the time Ms. MacPherson was a teenager, some board makers were trying different materials and more manageable designs. “So Janet was in the right place to benefit from shorter, lighter surfboards,” he noted.

Another development at the time was the creation of the wet suit. One of Ms. MacPherson’s friends was Jack O’Neill, a pioneer in manufacturing and marketing the gear, which made surfing in cold water bearable. But in her early days, Ms. MacPherson said, she came up with her own solution to the temperature problem.

“We used to go to the thrift stores and buy cashmere sweaters and wear them out in the water to keep warm,” she told Whalebone.

Though Mr. O’Neill was a friend, she always preferred warm water. “I hate wet suits with a passion,” she admitted.

Ms. MacPherson and her friends traveled the world surfing, and in the 1960s she found herself in Australia and New Zealand, where she met and married Tim Murdoch, a fellow surfer and Mr. MacPherson’s father. Although the marriage ended in divorce, she was in New Zealand long enough be crowned its women’s surfing champion in 1965.

When she wasn’t surfing, she was developing a modest real estate business, acquiring rental properties in Malibu.

A favorite surfing spot for Ms. MacPherson and her son was Shipwreck, off the Baja peninsula in Mexico. While on a trip there in 1981, she met Stephen Farbus, who was on a surfing trip of his own. They married in 2003. In addition to him and her son, she is survived by a sister, Marie MacPherson, and two grandchildren.

Among those inspired by Ms. MacPherson’s adventurousness was her daughter-in-law, Rachelle Hruska MacPherson, founder of the Lingua Franca clothing label.

“To me, she embodies everything about female empowerment,” she said by email. “Doing what you want to do, how you want to do it, on your terms. She never once mentioned being a feminist. She didn’t have to — she just was.”
