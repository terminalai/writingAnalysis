If you’re as fussy about strawberries as I am, you know that they’re one of the most pesticide-laden fruits in the market. You haven’t really tasted their full flavor until you’ve tried locally grown varieties, which are a world away from the underripe fruit picked for shipping. Now there’s a new option on the local front, so New Yorkers won’t have to wait until late May. Bowery Farming, which, despite its name, grows greens in a giant indoor facility in Kearny, N.J., has just introduced Bowery Strawberries, two varieties packed together in 4-ounce containers. They’re free of pesticides, ripe and only available for a limited time. The berries labeled Garden are juicy and pretty, with decent flavor but not much aroma. The type called Wild look about the same as the Garden ones, but they are winners with a lovely perfume and a bright, tart sweetness. It should be noted that the farm labels the fruit “wild” even though they have nothing to do with the tiny berries generally known as fraises des bois, or wild strawberries.
